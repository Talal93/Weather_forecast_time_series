## Problem Statment

Climate change is a large-scale, long-term shift in the planetâ€™s weather patterns and average temperatures, with trends showing a move towards warmer, wetter and less predictable weather in Scotland. This will challenge established ways of living globally.

so here i am going to forecast the max, min and average temperature for the city of glasgow the capital of scotland

## Data dictionary

The data i am working on represents glasgow wether from 2015 to Nov-2019

and here is a table to make it clear what feature do we have:

|Feature|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**day**|*object*|Represents when the data recorded.| 
|**tempMin**|*float*|Represents the minimum temperature.|
|**tempMax**|*float*|Represent the maximum temperature.|
|**summary**|*object*|Description of the weather condition|
|**desc**|*object*|Description of the weather condition|
|**cloudCover**|*float*|The value of cloudcover|
|**humidity**|*float*|The value of humidity|
|**windSpeed**|*float*|The value of the wind speed|
|**visibility**|*float*|The value of the visibilty|

## Conclusion

so at the end we can see how accurate the forecasts is from the RMSE.

the RMSE for the max temperature = 2.4 

the RMSE for the minimum temperature = 1.3

the RMSE for the average temperature = 1.4
